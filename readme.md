## UI in a day challenge.

This is a challenge I used to do with my friends where we join a voice chat (usually Discord) and build the UI in a single day and have fun.

### Disclaimer, I don't own any of the UIs I'm not the designer. I only re-built them with flutter to practice.

### each folder is a flutter project.
